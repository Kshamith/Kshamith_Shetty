# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kshamith Shetty, a final year BCA student with a passion for web development. Currently diving deep into the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, I've crafted a few unique projects that showcase my skills and enthusiasm for creating engaging web applications. As a technology enthusiast, I thrive on learning new concepts and staying updated with the latest trends in the ever-evolving world of web development.
